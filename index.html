            The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy,
            physics, philosophy, and metaphysics. The following is an overview of different
            theories related to the cosmos:

                    <p>
                        This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the
                        universe. The Big Bang theory suggests that the history of the universe
                        began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a result of
                        the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the
                        expansion of the cosmos.

                    <p>
                        Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are
                        regions where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can
                        escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can emit radiation.

                        String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the
                        physical world. According to this theory, we live in a three-dimensional
                        space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional microscopic,
                        non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined
                        spaces with different sizes and characteristics.
